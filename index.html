                        <p>The city's reliance on the social services sector has increased once again to address the needs of thousands of newly arrived migrants.</p> 
                            
                        <p>Over 136,000 asylum seekers have come through the city's social services system since the spring of last year, according to the Office of the Comptroller. The influx of new clients has made chronic issues, such as high turnover rates and caseloads, more apparent for case-management workers, who have dealt with those issues since before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet case workers continue to be underpaid despite working through two major social welfare crises.</p>

                        <p>Case management addresses a client's complex needs, from homelessness and housing to childcare and mental health. A case manager may help a client navigate only a certain aspect of the social services system, such as assessment or evaluation. In other situations, case-management workers oversee the entirety of the client's case.</p> 

                        <p>Most companies require case managers to have attained a bachelor's degree in social work with at least one year of experience working with a specific population.</p>

                        </script>

                        <p>"The sector wants to step up in moments of crisis, whether it's funded or not," said Michelle Jackson, executive director of the Human Services Council. "But because of the lack of investment in the human-services sector over the last two decades, the sector is unable to rise to these moments of crisis."</p>
